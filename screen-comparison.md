## Summary

- **Total Screens Required:** 78
- **Implemented:** 12 (15.4%)
- **Missing:** 66 (84.6%)

## Critical Gap

**The PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATOR feature (Quality Verification Photos) is completely missing from the admin dashboard!**

This includes:
- Screen 16: Quality Verification Review
- Screen 71: Quality Photo Analytics

Without these screens, the admin cannot manage the core feature that differentiates Okada from competitors.
