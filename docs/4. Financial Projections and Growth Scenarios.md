## 4. Financial Projections and Growth Scenarios

This section outlines a preliminary 3-year financial projection for Okada, based on a set of realistic assumptions for the Cameroonian market. These projections are intended to provide a high-level overview of the potential financial trajectory of the business and should be refined as more market data becomes available.

### 4.1. Key Assumptions

The financial model is built on the following key assumptions:

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Footprint** | | | | |
| Number of Cities | 2 | 2 | 3 | Douala & Yaoundé, then expanding to a third city. |
| Number of Dark Stores | 4 | 8 | 12 | Phased rollout of dark stores in target cities. |
| **Order Volume** | | | | |
| Avg. Orders per Dark Store per Day | 50 | 100 | 150 | Assumes gradual increase in order density as brand awareness grows. |
| **Unit Economics** | | | | |
| Average Order Value (AOV) | 8,500 XAF | 8,750 XAF | 9,000 XAF | Assumes a modest increase in AOV over time. |
| Contribution Margin per Order | 941 XAF | 1,150 XAF | 1,350 XAF | Assumes margin improvement through economies of scale and operational efficiency. |
| **Fixed Costs** | | | | |
| Avg. Monthly Fixed Cost per Dark Store | 1,150,000 XAF | 1,200,000 XAF | 1,250,000 XAF | Includes rent, utilities, and staff salaries. |
| Monthly Central Fixed Costs | 5,000,000 XAF | 8,000,000 XAF | 12,000,000 XAF | Includes marketing, admin, and technology costs. |

### 4.2. 3-Year Financial Projections (in XAF)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue & Contribution** | | | |
| Total Annual Orders | 73,000 | 292,000 | 657,000 |
| Total Contribution Margin | **68,693,000** | **335,800,000** | **886,950,000** |
| | | | |
| **Fixed Costs** | | | |
| Total Dark Store Fixed Costs | (55,200,000) | (115,200,000) | (180,000,000) |
| Total Central Fixed Costs | (60,000,000) | (96,000,000) | (144,000,000) |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **(115,200,000)** | **(211,200,000)** | **(324,000,000)** |
| | | | |
| **Profitability** | | | |
| **EBITDA** | **(46,507,000)** | **124,600,000** | **562,950,000** |
| EBITDA Margin | N/A | 37.1% | 63.5% |

### 4.3. Growth Scenarios

**Conservative Scenario:**

- Slower adoption of quick commerce, resulting in lower order volumes (25-30% below projection).
- Higher customer acquisition costs due to a more competitive market.
- Slower path to profitability, with breakeven potentially delayed to Year 3 or 4.

**Aggressive Scenario:**

- Rapid adoption of quick commerce, leading to higher order volumes (40-50% above projection).
- Faster expansion to new cities and a larger dark store network.
- Higher initial investment required, but a faster path to significant market share and profitability.

### 4.4. Funding Requirements

Based on the financial projections, Okada will require an initial seed investment to cover the startup costs and the operational losses in the first year. A seed round of **$250,000 - $350,000 USD (approx. 150-210 million XAF)** would be sufficient to fund the first 12-18 months of operations and achieve a positive EBITDA run rate.

Subsequent funding rounds (Series A) will be required to finance the expansion in Year 2 and beyond, with the amount depending on the growth trajectory and market conditions.

These financial projections demonstrate a clear path to profitability for Okada, driven by a scalable business model and strong unit economics. The key to success will be disciplined execution, continuous optimization of operations, and a deep understanding of the local market dynamics of the Cameroonian market.
