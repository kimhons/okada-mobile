# Okada Platform: Comprehensive User Journeys & Screen Inventory

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the user journeys and screen requirements for the Okada quick commerce platform in Cameroon. The platform consists of three interconnected applications:

1. **Customer Mobile App**: Enables users to browse products, place orders, and track deliveries

## Cross-Platform Integration Points

The three applications are designed to work together seamlessly with several key integration points:

### Order Lifecycle Integration

The complete order lifecycle flows through all three applications:

1. **Customer App**: Order creation and payment
2. **Merchant Platform**: Order acceptance and preparation
3. **Rider App**: Order pickup and delivery
4. **Customer App**: Delivery confirmation and rating

### Real-Time Communication

Real-time updates are synchronized across applications:

1. **Order Status Updates**: All parties see current order status
2. **Location Tracking**: Customer and merchant can track rider location
3. **Chat Functionality**: Direct communication between customer and rider
4. **Inventory Updates**: Stock levels updated in real-time

### Data Synchronization

Critical data is synchronized across the platform:

1. **Product Catalog**: Updated from merchant platform to customer app
2. **User Profiles**: Consistent across all touchpoints
3. **Delivery Zones**: Coordinated between merchant and rider apps
4. **Ratings and Reviews**: Shared between customer and merchant views

## Cameroon-Specific Adaptations

All applications include adaptations for the Cameroonian market:

### Technical Adaptations

3. **Address Flexibility**: Support for landmark-based addressing
4. **Visual Design**: Cameroon flag colors (green, red, yellow) for branding

## Development Considerations

### Phased Implementation Approach

The platform can be developed in phases to manage complexity:

1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality for all three applications (50% of screens)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced features and integrations (30% of screens)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features and optimizations (20% of screens)

### Technical Architecture Implications

The screen inventory has several implications for technical architecture:
