# Zepto Business Model Research

## Company Overview
**Founded**: 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra  
**Headquarters**: Mumbai, India  
**Valuation**: ~$5 billion (late 2024)  
**Core Promise**: 10-minute grocery delivery  
**Market Position**: Leading quick commerce platform in India

## Core Business Model Components

### 1. Ultra-Fast Delivery System
Zepto has revolutionized grocery delivery with its 10-minute promise, achieving a median delivery time of 8 minutes 47 seconds. This ultra-fast delivery model addresses the immediate needs of busy urban consumers who require instant access to essential items like missing ingredients or household necessities.

The delivery process operates through a streamlined system where customer orders are immediately routed to the nearest fulfillment center, and delivery partners collect items almost instantly. This speed has created a competitive advantage that drives customer satisfaction and loyalty, making it difficult for users to return to traditional hour-long or day-long delivery services.

### 2. Dark Store Network (Micro-Fulfillment Centers)
The foundation of Zepto's business model lies in its network of strategically positioned dark stores - mini-warehouses dedicated exclusively to online order fulfillment. These micro-fulfillment centers are located within 1.5 to 4 kilometers of customer clusters, ensuring 10-minute delivery feasibility.

Each dark store is optimized for speed and efficiency, designed specifically for rapid item picking and packing rather than customer browsing. Advanced software directs staff to item locations, and inventory is arranged to minimize collection time. By owning and operating these fulfillment nodes, Zepto maintains complete control over the supply chain from shelf to customer door.

### 3. Curated Essential Inventory
Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms with millions of products, Zepto focuses on a carefully curated selection of approximately 2,500 SKUs per micro-warehouse. The inventory concentrates on high-demand daily essentials including fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products, snacks, beverages, personal care items, and cleaning supplies.

This focused approach serves multiple strategic purposes: it ensures fast-moving products remain consistently in stock, accelerates the picking process through compact and optimized warehouse layouts, and creates a business model built on high-demand, fast-moving inventory that keeps operations lean and efficient.

### 4. Direct Sales and Inventory Management
Zepto operates an "inventory-led" model, owning and managing the products it sells rather than functioning as a marketplace middleman. The company sources products directly from manufacturers, farmers, and large distributors, stocking goods in its warehouses.

This direct approach provides several advantages: tight control over the entire value chain from procurement to delivery, ability to negotiate bulk prices, maintenance of consistent stock levels, implementation of strict quality control measures, and efficient inventory redistribution between locations to reduce waste.

### 5. Subscription Model - Zepto Pass
To enhance customer retention and create additional revenue streams, Zepto introduced Zepto Pass, a subscription-based membership program. The service offers members benefits including free deliveries, exclusive discounts, and priority customer support.

Pricing ranges from ₹39 for introductory trials to ₹149-299 per month depending on the plan. Members receive free delivery on orders above minimal amounts (typically ₹99), additional cashback or discounts on products, and partner offers. This subscription model increases customer lifetime value and provides steady revenue to offset thin delivery margins.
