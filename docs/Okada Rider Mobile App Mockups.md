The financial performance dashboard featuring:

The earnings screen provides comprehensive financial information with flexible time period selection (day, week, month). The earnings summary prominently displays the total amount earned in the selected period with a comparison to previous periods. The visual chart illustrates earning patterns across the selected timeframe, helping riders identify peak earning days or times. The transaction history lists completed deliveries with date, order number, route information, and earnings per delivery. Payment method icons indicate whether the order was paid via mobile money or cash, helping riders reconcile their accounts.

## Design Elements

### Color Palette

The rider app utilizes a focused color scheme that maintains brand consistency while optimizing for outdoor visibility and quick recognition:

The primary green (#1E5631) serves as the brand color used for headers, key information, and status indicators. The accent orange (#FF8C00) is used for primary action buttons and important highlights that require immediate attention. White (#FFFFFF) provides contrast for text and interactive elements against darker backgrounds. Light gray (#F5F5F5) is used for secondary backgrounds and subtle dividers. Map colors are optimized for outdoor visibility with high contrast between routes and background elements.

### Typography

The typography system prioritizes legibility in outdoor conditions:

Headings use a sans-serif font in bold weight at 18-22px, providing clear information hierarchy even in bright sunlight. Body text employs a sans-serif font in medium weight at 16px, optimizing for quick reading while on the move. Numerical information uses a slightly larger size (18px) to ensure quick comprehension of distances, times, and earnings.

### UI Components

The interface components are designed for efficiency and ease of use while mobile:

Large touch targets accommodate usage while wearing delivery gloves or in moving vehicles. High contrast colors ensure visibility in various lighting conditions, including bright sunlight. Simplified layouts reduce cognitive load during busy delivery periods. Status indicators use both color and icons to convey information clearly. Map elements are sized appropriately for quick glances while navigating.

## Functionality Considerations

The rider app is designed with several key operational considerations:

Offline functionality ensures core features remain available in areas with poor connectivity. Battery optimization reduces power consumption during extended delivery shifts. Background location tracking balances accuracy with battery preservation. Push notifications alert riders to new order opportunities even when the app is not active. One-handed operation is supported through bottom-positioned key controls.

## Technical Implementation Notes

The rider app is designed for implementation as a native mobile application:

The app architecture prioritizes offline-first functionality with local data storage and synchronization when connectivity is restored. Map data is cached for commonly served areas to reduce data usage and improve performance in low-connectivity zones. Battery optimization includes intelligent GPS polling that adjusts based on movement and delivery status. The app is designed to function on mid-range Android devices, which are most common among delivery personnel in the Cameroonian market.
