## Brand Identity

### Logo

The Okada logo represents the core concept of the platform through a distinctive motorcycle delivery icon:

- **Primary Logo**: The wordmark "OKADA" in clean, modern typography (Montserrat Bold or similar) in white against Okada Green (#007A5E), paired with a motorcycle delivery rider icon in Okada Yellow (#FCD116)
- **Icon**: A simplified motorcycle delivery rider silhouette in Okada Yellow (#FCD116), representing the platform's quick commerce delivery service
- **Clear Space**: Maintain padding around the logo equal to the height of the "O" in OKADA
- **Minimum Size**: 24px height for digital applications to ensure legibility
- **Variations**: 
  - Full logo (icon + wordmark) for primary applications
  - Icon-only for app icons and small-space applications
  - Wordmark-only for certain horizontal applications

### Logo Usage Guidelines

- **Primary Application**: Okada Green (#007A5E) background with yellow icon and white text
- **Reversed Application**: White background with Okada Green text and yellow icon
- **Clear Space**: Always maintain minimum clear space around the logo
- **Do Not**: Stretch, recolor, rotate, or otherwise modify the logo
- **Placement**: Centered for splash screens and app icons, left-aligned for navigation bars

### Logo Symbolism

The motorcycle icon in the Okada logo carries significant meaning:
- Directly represents the "Okada" name (referring to motorcycle taxis common in West Africa)
- Symbolizes speed, reliability, and accessibility
- Communicates the delivery service aspect of the platform
- Uses the yellow from Cameroon's flag, reinforcing the local connection

This logo should be used consistently across all platform components to build brand recognition and maintain visual cohesion.
