# The Problem

## Current Challenges in Cameroon's Urban Retail Landscape

### Time-Consuming Shopping Experience
Urban Cameroonians spend an average of 5-7 hours weekly navigating traffic, crowded markets, and long checkout lines for essential groceries.

### Limited Convenience Options
Despite 55% internet penetration and 70% smartphone adoption, the convenience economy remains underdeveloped with few reliable delivery services.

### Fragmented Supply Chain
Consumers must visit multiple locations (markets, supermarkets, specialty shops) to complete their shopping, increasing time and transportation costs.

### Payment Friction
Cash dominance creates security concerns and exact change problems, despite 40.76% mobile money adoption that could enable seamless transactions.

### Quality and Consistency Issues
Inconsistent product availability and quality standards at traditional markets create frustration and waste for urban consumers.
