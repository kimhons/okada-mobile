## Critical Path Dependencies

The implementation timeline includes several critical path dependencies that must be managed carefully:

1. **AI Infrastructure**: The AI Brain must be operational before AI features can be integrated into the apps.

2. **Backend Services**: Core backend services must be functional before the apps can implement features that depend on them.

3. **Data Collection**: Initial data collection is necessary for training AI models, which may require synthetic data or partnerships for the first iterations.

4. **Testing in Cameroon**: Real-world testing in Cameroon is essential for validating performance under actual conditions.

## Milestone Review Points

The implementation plan includes formal milestone reviews at the end of each phase:

1. **Foundation Review** (End of Month 2): Validate that the core infrastructure and basic functionality are in place.

2. **MVP Review** (End of Month 4): Evaluate the MVP's readiness for limited user testing.

3. **Enhanced Features Review** (End of Month 6): Assess the platform's performance and AI capabilities.

4. **Launch Readiness Review** (End of Month 8): Determine if the platform is ready for full market launch.

These milestone reviews provide opportunities to adjust the plan based on progress, feedback, and changing requirements.
