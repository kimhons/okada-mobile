## 6. Performance Measurement and Optimization Framework

A data-driven approach to performance measurement and optimization will be at the heart of Okada's marketing strategy. This framework will enable the team to track progress against key objectives, make informed decisions, and continuously improve the effectiveness of its marketing efforts.

### 6.1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 6.2. Marketing Analytics Stack

Okada will implement a modern, lightweight marketing analytics stack to track and analyze these KPIs.

- **Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP):** **AppsFlyer** or **Adjust** to track app installs, in-app events, and attribute them to the correct marketing channels.
- **Product Analytics:** **Mixpanel** or **Amplitude** to analyze user behavior within the app, track conversion funnels, and identify areas for improvement.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** A simple, cost-effective CRM like **HubSpot for Startups** to manage customer data, segment users, and automate marketing campaigns.
- **Business Intelligence (BI) Tool:** **Google Data Studio** or **Metabase** to create a centralized marketing dashboard that visualizes all the key KPIs in real-time.

### 6.3. Reporting and Optimization Process

A regular cadence of reporting and optimization will ensure that the marketing team is constantly learning and improving.

- **Daily Huddle (15 mins):** A quick daily check-in to review the key performance metrics from the previous day and identify any immediate issues or opportunities.
- **Weekly Performance Review (1 hour):** A more in-depth weekly meeting to review the performance of all marketing campaigns, analyze trends, and plan the priorities for the upcoming week.
- **Monthly Strategy Review (2-3 hours):** A monthly meeting with the leadership team to review progress against the monthly and quarterly goals, discuss key learnings, and make any necessary adjustments to the marketing strategy.
- **Quarterly Planning Session (1 day):** A quarterly offsite to review the performance of the previous quarter, conduct a SWOT analysis, and develop the marketing plan for the upcoming quarter.

This disciplined approach to performance measurement and optimization will enable Okada to maximize its return on marketing investment, drive sustainable growth, and build a data-driven culture from day one.
